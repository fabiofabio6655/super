🚀 *Data-Driven Insights for Supermarket Sales!* 🛒

I’m excited to share a recent project I worked on, where I developed an interactive sales report analysis using Power BI for supermarket branches.

🔍 *Key Highlights:*
- *Total Revenue for Branches:* $322.97K
- *Gross Income:* $15.38K
- *Cost of Goods Sold (COGS):* $307.59K
- *Average Branch Rating:* 6.97

📊 *Detailed Breakdown:*
- *Revenue by Customer Type:* Members and normal customers contribute nearly equally, showing diverse customer engagement.
- *Revenue by Gender:* Slightly higher sales from male customers.
- *Revenue by City:* Consistent performance across different cities, with Mandalay slightly leading.
- *Revenue by Branch:* Balanced revenue distribution among the three branches.

🎯 With dynamic filters for Branch, Gender, and City, this dashboard provides an intuitive way to slice and dice the data for deeper insights, helping stakeholders make informed decisions.
